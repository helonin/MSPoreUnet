# MSPoreU-net: A novel U-net architecture to exploit multi-scale pores in segmentation of digital rock images 
MSPoreU-net is a unet workflow for better results in performance, run time, the number of trainable parameters, and network predictions in rock image segmentation. To assess the performance of the proposed MSPoreU-net architecture, we have tested and evaluated it on three different sets of rock images including Tight-carbonate, Sandstone, and Carbonate. 
We visualize some outputs of employed methods on all three datasets, to qualitatively demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed MSPoreU-net model in below figure:
