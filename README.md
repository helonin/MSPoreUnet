# MSPoreU-net: A novel U-net architecture to exploit multi-scale pores in segmentation of digital rock images 
MSPoreU-net is a unet workflow for better results in performance, run time, the number of trainable parameters, and network predictions in rock image segmentation. To assess the performance of the proposed MSPoreU-net architecture, we have tested and evaluated it on three different sets of rock images including Tight-carbonate, Sandstone, and Carbonate.
